Level-wise Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Deep Learning
Early diagnosis and treatment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) can reduce the risk of vision loss.
 There are ve stages of DR consisting of no DR, mild DR, moderate DR, severe DR, and proliferate DR.
 This paper presents a multitask deep learning model to detect all the ve stages of DR more accurately than
 existing methods. The developed multitask model consists of one classi cation model and one regression
 model, each with its own loss function. After training the regression model and the classi cation model
 separately, the features extracted by these two models are concatenated and inputted to a multilayer
 perceptron network to classify the ve stages of DR.
